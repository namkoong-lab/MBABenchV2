"""
WebAgent Abstract Base Class - Strategy Pattern for web-based AI agents.

This module defines the common interface that all web-based AI agents
(e.g., ClaudeWebAgent, ChatGPTWebAgent) must implement. The engine and
batch runner operate against this base class type, allowing new agents
to be added without modifying orchestration logic.

Classes:
    WebAgentState: Enum of possible agent states.
    ConversationMessage: Dataclass representing a single conversation turn.
    WebAgent: Abstract base class defining the agent interface.

"""Uncached-formula pre-flight (Class E of the 2026-09-01 evidence sweep).

The judge reads cached formula *results*, never live ones: extraction loads the
workbook twice (`data_only=False` for formulas, `data_only=True` for values) and
`_get_formatted_value` returns the empty string whenever the cached value is
``None``. A workbook saved without calculation — the classic openpyxl-produced
attempt — therefore reaches the judge as formulas with no values anywhere:

    [B4]1,234|FORMULA:=SUM(B1:B3)     <- calculated, value visible
    |FORMULA:=SUM(B1:B3)              <- never calculated, value gone

Nothing downstream notices. The Accuracy category (19% of the score, including
the single 10.36-point `Final calculation accuracy` check) then has no evidence
behind it, and the grade that comes out looks exactly like a real one. Under a
strictness rule ("undecided is a fail") it becomes a mechanical Accuracy zero —
scoring the attempt's *save path* rather than its quality.

This module refuses that grading instead.

Two censuses, workbook first
----------------------------
The CSV encoding cannot tell a formula that *legitimately returns the empty
string* (``=IF($A215="","",...)`` in the spare rows of a schedule) from one
that was never calculated — both print a blank display half. A workbook built
that way (2026-09-03: a 10,251-formula bond schedule with 7,221 blank-result
rows) was refused at "70% uncached" while being fully calculated.

The workbook XML does tell them apart, and every producer we see agrees:

    <c t="str"><f>..</f><v></v></c>   Excel / Excel Online / LibreOffice:
                                      calculated, result is the empty string
    <c><f>..</f><v /></c>             openpyxl: never calculated (no type,
                                      empty value element)
    <c t="n"><f>..</f><v>200</v></c>  calculated, numeric (or t="str"/"b"/"e"
                                      with content)

So when the source workbook is on disk, `check_case` decides on a *workbook*
census: a formula cell is uncached iff its ``<v>`` is absent or empty AND the
cell is not typed ``str``. The CSV census is still computed and recorded (it
measures exactly what the judge reads, and it is the only census available
when the CSVs came from cache and no workbook was staged), and it remains the
deciding basis when no workbook path is given. ``provenance[label]["basis"]``
says which one decided.

Enforcement is wired in `judge._prepare_case`, so every mode inherits it —
classic, agentic, and single-pass. Set ``JUDGE_SKIP_FORMULA_CACHE_CHECK=1`` to
grade anyway; the skip is recorded in ``scored_results.formula_cache`` so such
rows stay identifiable.

The fix, when it fires for real, is to re-extract with ``--run-calculation``
(a LibreOffice recalculation pass), or to repair the source workbook.

"""Deterministic rubric checks in the judge (judge v13).

`detchecks` (judge/detchecks/, API in detchecks/docs/reader.md) grades rubric_9 checks in
Python from the DELIVERED workbook. This module is the only place the judge calls it:

    run = run_det_checks(task_folder, rubric_path=..., weights_path=..., mode=None)
    harness_verdicts = merge_harness_verdicts(answer_check_verdicts, run.harness_verdicts)
    single_pass_judge_case(..., harness_verdicts=harness_verdicts, det_checks=run.for_judge())

What runs
  project_configs.yaml det_checks.live           the Python verdict replaces the LLM's at scoring
  project_configs.yaml det_checks.recorded_only  the Python verdict is recorded beside the LLM's,
                                                 and the LLM's counts
  Both are rubric numbers. Each number is pinned to its (category, name) in DET_CHECK_NAMES and
  checked against the loaded rubric and the detchecks registry; any mismatch refuses to grade
  (numbering drift must never move a verdict onto the wrong check). A configured live check
  must also be live in detchecks (Check.live). A check is graded only when the task's
  rubric-suitability gate leaves it applicable (retired checks never are) and the effective
  weights score it: the same gate judge._apply_harness_verdicts applies.

Representation (the judge's harness_verdicts format, key "<Category>/<check name>")
  live           engine "harness", decision, summary, mistakes, fallback_reason None,
                 family "det_checks", live True, check_no, n_mistakes, stats
  recorded only  the same with engine "llm", live False and fallback_reason = detchecks'
                 LIVE_NOTE ("recorded only; the LLM verdict stands at scoring")
  `engine` keeps its one meaning for every reader: "harness" = this verdict may replace the
  LLM's; "llm" = the LLM's verdict stands (here with the Python decision recorded beside it).
  judge._apply_harness_verdicts records decision, llm_decision and `agreed` for both kinds and
  overlays engine "harness" entries only.

The switch (--det-checks on every driver; default from det_checks.enabled: true -> harness)
  harness  live Python verdicts count in the recorded total (judge v13 default)
  llm      everything runs and is recorded; the LLM's verdicts count (shadow run;
           scored_results.accuracy_engine.total_score_harness still shows the v13 total)
  off      nothing runs; scored_results.det_checks says so
  --accuracy-check keeps deciding the answer check (Final calculation accuracy) on its own.

No fallback (maintainer, 2026-10-02)
  A check that cannot grade the file raises detchecks' GradingError; run_det_checks writes the
  failure to det_checks.json and raises DetChecksError naming every failing check by title and
  the file. Every driver calls it FIRST - before the answer check (which recalculates through
  LibreOffice too, so a file refused here never reaches it) and the LLM - so the attempt fails
  the way the formula-cache refusal does (grade_from_db logs FAILED, no DB row, the batch
  continues) with no API spend.
  Nothing here ever turns a failure into an LLM verdict. This holds in `llm` mode too: when the
  checks run, they run loudly.

Values (detchecks/docs/recalc.md)
  Structure and styles come from task_folder/ai_attempt.xlsx, the delivered file (never
  temp_recalculated/; a legacy .xls delivery is the one exception, below). Formula values: an
  Excel-saved file's own caches (any size); any other
  writer's file is recalculated by LibreOffice (paths.libreoffice_path) into task_folder/
  det_checks_recalc/ (the copy and the private profiles), which run_det_checks deletes itself
  as soon as the checks return or raise, in every driver (_remove_recalc_dir; det_checks.json
  stays). Excel recalculation is OFF (det_checks.excel_recalc); cells LibreOffice
  cannot compute are used as displayed.
  Every attempt is graded, whatever its size (maintainer 2026-10-05): det_checks.libreoffice_max_mb
  is 0 = no limit in production (a positive value, for test runs only, refuses larger files that
  need LibreOffice: "not graded: too large"). Memory safety instead (detchecks/core/lo_guard.py),
  for EVERY LibreOffice run of a grading - this pipeline, the answer check's recalculation and
  --run-calculation (run_libreoffice below): one LibreOffice at a time on the machine
  (det_checks.libreoffice_lock_path, default /tmp/mbabench_libreoffice.lock, waited for at most
  det_checks.libreoffice_max_lock_wait_minutes), started only once
  det_checks.libreoffice_min_free_pct of memory is free (waiting at most
  det_checks.libreoffice_max_wait_minutes), a failed run (crash, no copy, timeout) retried
  det_checks.libreoffice_retries times with the timeout doubled. When that is exhausted the grading
  fails loudly with retry_later set (DetChecksError / LibreOfficeUnavailable): FAILED, no DB row,
  the batch continues, and the drivers list the attempt at the end of the run to be re-run when
  the machine has memory to spare (retry_later_report).
  LibreOffice never outlives the grading (detchecks/docs/recalc.md, "The LibreOffice process"):
  its paths are encoded file URLs (a task folder with a space or '%'); it runs in the grader's
  process group under a watchdog that kills it when the grader dies (SIGKILL included); a
  SIGTERM / SIGHUP handler, installed by startup_check and run_det_checks from the main thread,
  kills it before the grader dies of the signal; and _reap_libreoffice sweeps this grading's
  private profiles (raw or URL form) when the checks return or raise.

Legacy .xls deliveries (maintainer 2026-10-05: "just keep doing whatever v12 did or does")
  grade_from_db stages the first .xlsx / .xlsm / .xls delivery as ai_attempt.xlsx without
  converting it. legacy_xls() tells from the bytes (as detchecks.core.package classifies them,
  whatever the name) that the staged file is a legacy binary Excel workbook: an OLE2 compound
  file holding a Workbook / Book stream. Then, as in judge v12:
  - with --run-calculation (run_det_checks(..., run_calculation=True); v12 grades LibreOffice's
    re-saved copy): LibreOffice converts it to .xlsx through the pipeline's own LibreOffice step
    (the memory guard, private profile, watchdog and reaper above; a test-run size limit applies)
    into det_checks_recalc/xls_converted/ai_attempt.xlsx, and every check except File extension
    (.xlsx) (77) grades that copy: structure, styles and values. LibreOffice recalculates every
    formula of an .xls it loads, so the copy's values are LibreOffice's own; the recalculation
    pipeline takes them from the copy (no second LibreOffice run; gaps as usual). File extension
    (.xlsx) (77) grades the delivered file and its delivered name, and fails. Recorded in
    det_checks.json "xls_conversion", scored_results.det_checks.xls_conversion and each verdict's
    stats.graded_on ("libreoffice_xlsx_conversion" / "delivered_file"). The copy goes with
    det_checks_recalc/. The judge's own --run-calculation re-save (temp_recalculated/, after the
    checks and the answer check, v12's code) converts the file again; the checks never read it.
  - without --run-calculation: unchanged, the checks other than File extension (.xlsx) (77) cannot
    read .xls bytes, so the grading fails loudly before the LLM call (the error says to re-run
    with --run-calculation; det_checks.json "xls_conversion" says why); v12 fails too (openpyxl
    cannot open the file).
  .xlsx / .xlsm deliveries, an encrypted package, an OLE2 file without a workbook stream (or with
  an unreadable directory) and .xlsb (never staged) are graded exactly as before.

Task metadata
  delivered_filename       from the _attempt_origin.json sidecar (original_filename). Without
                           it, or with a malformed sidecar (read_origin: not JSON, not an object,
                           no non-empty original_filename), File extension (.xlsx) (77) judges
                           the format from the file's content (maintainer 2026-10-05: every
                           attempt graded; task_meta delivered_filename_problem says why, and
                           the verdict's stats.defaults records it).
  requires_external_links  always False (maintainer: no task requires external links).

Artefacts
  task_folder/det_checks.json  everything (config, gate, task_meta, the full verdicts and the
                               full recalculation block, or the failure and its stage);
                               written in every case, also when a config error, a rubric
                               drift or a suitability refusal stops the run;
                               judge._finalize_case copies it into the output dir
  scored_results.det_checks    compact block (status, mode, per-check engine / decision / live /
                               n_mistakes / summary capped at DB_SUMMARY_CAP characters), the
                               recalculation block `values` ONCE (no local value_path) and, for a
                               legacy .xls delivery only, `xls_conversion`

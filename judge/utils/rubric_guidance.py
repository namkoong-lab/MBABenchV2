"""Judge-only grading guidance, layered onto rubric checks at prompt time.

Why this file exists (2026-09-01, Patrick): repeat gradings of the same
attempt flip on checks whose *scope* is ambiguous — does formatting count
against Accuracy? do hardcodes inherited from the starting workbook count
against Flexibility? The guidance notes answer exactly those scope
questions so the judge applies one consistent rule instead of coin-flipping.

Why it is a separate file and NOT part of rubric_9.json:
  - rubric_9.json is generated from the agent-facing build prompt
    (operation_scripts/build_rubric_9_from_prompt.py) so the rubric agents
    see and the rubric the judge grades can never drift apart. Editing the
    JSON by hand gets silently wiped by the next regeneration.
  - Putting the guidance in the agents' prompt instead would change what
    agents are told — new prompt versions, re-run waves. These notes change
    how the JUDGE reads the rubric, not what agents are asked to do.

The guidance file is a sibling of the rubric it annotates
(<rubric_stem>_guidance.yaml, e.g. rubric_9_guidance.yaml). Structure:

    general: |            # overall rules, rendered once per prompt
      ...
    categories:           # per-category notes, rendered above the checks
      Accuracy: |
        ...
    checks:               # per-check notes, rendered under the check text
      - category: Accuracy
        name: Final calculation accuracy
        note: |
          ...

Loading validates every (category, name) against the rubric JSON and fails
loudly on drift, so a rubric revision that renames a check cannot silently
orphan its guidance. A rubric with no guidance sibling (rubric_8) loads as
None and everything renders exactly as before.

Applied identically in both v2 grading modes (12-category and single-pass)
so mode comparisons are never confounded by different standards.

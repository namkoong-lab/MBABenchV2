    Unlike judge_case, this function:

    - Builds prompts dynamically from rubric descriptions and file metadata
    - Uses multi-turn tool-calling so the judge LLM can query specific files
    - Optionally carries over findings between category evaluations

    Args:
        task_folder: Path to the task folder containing Excel files.
        client: OpenAI-compatible client from get_client(identity).
        rubric_path: Path to the rubric JSON file.
        rubric_weight_path: Path to the rubric weights JSON file.
        model: Grader label from judge_identities.yaml; pins the endpoint,
            wire model id, and default effort.
        nocall: If True, skip API calls (for testing).
        noupload: If True, skip file preparation (for testing).
        use_existing: If True, skip regenerating files if they already exist.
        attempt_model: Name of the AI model that generated the attempt.
        run_calculation: If True, run Excel formula calculations before extraction.
        cached_solution_csv_dir: Path to pre-extracted solution CSVs.
        cached_attempt_csv_dir: Path to pre-extracted attempt CSVs.
        attempt_sheet_name_filter: If True, filter attempt sheets by name prefix.
        carry_over_context: If True, include prior category findings in subsequent
            category prompts.
        max_tool_rounds: Maximum number of tool-calling rounds per category.
        auto_routed: True iff this run was auto-routed from ``judge_case`` because
            the standard judge would have overflowed the char budget. Recorded
            in ``_metadata.json`` and the result dict so downstream bookkeeping
            (DB writes, experiment analysis) can distinguish "agentic by config"

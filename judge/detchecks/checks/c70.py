"""70 Formatting/Reasonable column widths.

Rubric: "Column widths should not be excessive."  Good: "Columns are no wider than their content
requires; several full-width columns fit on screen at once, and long text is wrapped rather than
accommodated by widening the column."  Bad: "The model contains excessively wide columns (rule of
thumb: wider than roughly 75-80 characters at the default font), or long text is left unwrapped."

Rule as implemented (the toys' wording; every judgement call is a module constant below):

  Units.  A column's width is what Excel's Column Width dialog shows: characters of the workbook's
  Normal font, (px - 5) / MDW, where px is the column's pixel width at 96 dpi from its stored width
  (ECMA-376, exactly as Sufficient column widths (69): c69.col_px / c69.default_col_px, strict
  reading) and MDW the Normal font's maximum digit width in whole pixels.  Hidden and zero-width
  columns are skipped (No hidden rows/columns (93) owns them).  Every worksheet, dialog sheet and
  macro sheet is graded, hidden sheets included.  Overlapping <col> entries (GPT-6 tooling): a later
  entry (the reader's order: by min, then file order) overrides earlier ones on the columns it
  covers - the core reader's one rule (SheetHead.col_segments / col_info, shared with Sufficient
  column widths (69) and Reasonable row heights (73)).

  Content need of a column = its widest displayed content in the same characters: the text width of
  each displayed cell in the cell's own face, size and weight (c69's glyph tables, 96 dpi, per-glyph
  rounded advances) divided by MDW.  Numbers and dates: their displayed text (numfmt with the cell's
  format).  Booleans and errors: their text.  Unwrapped text: its full width (typed line breaks do
  not break an unwrapped cell).  Wrapped text (wrapText, or justify / distributed): its widest line,
  capped at the cap (WIDTH_CAP_CHARS): wrapped text can always wrap at the cap.  Rich text: run by
  run in each run's size and weight.  Indent adds 3 Normal-font spaces a level; rotated text needs
  its projection on the horizontal.  Cells in hidden rows or hidden columns are not displayed and
  need nothing.  Merged ranges: covered cells need nothing; the merged content needs the merged
  width, so each column of the span needs what the span's other visible columns leave
  (content - their pixels); a one-column merge counts in full.

  Test A (cap).  A visible column FAILS when it is wider than WIDTH_CAP_CHARS (80) AND more than
  EXCESS_FACTOR (2) times as wide as its content needs.  Empty columns with an explicit width over
  the cap fail (need 0), and so do the columns of a sheet whose own default width is over the cap.

  Test B (WIDE OUTLIER).  The judge's tag (judge/utils/workbook_properties.wide_outlier_tags) ported
  on stored widths: inside the sheet's used range (first to last column holding a value or formula)
  the visible columns form runs of equal stored width (<col> widths rounded to 2 decimals; columns
  without one take sheetFormatPr/@defaultColWidth, else 8.43); a run of >= 2 columns at least
  WIDE_OUTLIER_RATIO (2.5) times as wide as the nearest run of >= 2 columns at least
  WIDE_OUTLIER_MIN_NEIGHBOUR (4) wide on BOTH sides, and no longer than the longer of the two, is a
  WIDE OUTLIER.  Extension (OUTLIER_UNEQUAL_GROUPS): >= 2 adjacent lone columns of unequal widths
  between two such neighbour runs, each at least 2.5 times as wide as both, form a group too (toy T2
  Fail's AE:AF are stored 48.0 and 35.78: the exact port never compares lone columns and misses
  them).  An outlier column FAILS when its content needs less than OUTLIER_NEED_SHARE (1/2) of its
  width (the toys' wording; the judge's guidance excuses a column "whose own content needs the
  width").

  No "long text left unwrapped" test (Patrick 2026-10-04): unwrapped text is a problem only when it
  is cut off, which Sufficient column widths (69) grades.  The former Test C (200+ character
  unwrapped text spilling into empty cells) is removed with its switches and stats.

  Case brief.  The guidance excludes "the case's own brief (the Instructions sheet the agent was
  given) ... including its text wrapping and column widths"; Patrick's rule grades the whole
  workbook.  EXCLUDE_CASE_BRIEF = False: the sheet named "Instructions" (c74.is_instructions_sheet)
  is graded by Tests A and B.

  stats["switches"] gives the verdict under each alternative setting (cap 75, outlier share 0.75,
  exact judge port, brief excluded, the judge's sheet skip); they never decide.

Values (needs_values).  Constants are read from the file.  A formula result's value is read only
for cells of columns being judged (Tests A / B), and only when trusted (the recalc pipeline supplies
a value for every non-Excel file).  An untrusted value matters only when its column's measured need
is still under the line; if the workbook fails anyway such cells are listed in stats
(UNTRUSTED_ONLY_IF_VERDICT_NEEDS), otherwise the first one raises GradingError (no fallback).

Mistakes: one per run of adjacent failing columns with the same test(s) per sheet (location
'Sheet'!H:H, 'Sheet'!AE:AF), naming the widths, the content need with its widest cell, and the test.

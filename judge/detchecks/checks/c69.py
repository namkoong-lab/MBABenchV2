"""69 Formatting/Sufficient column widths.

Rubric: "All values display fully; no truncation or '###'" / bad: "Some columns truncate values or
show '###'".  Two rules, both "sure" (they fail a cell only when it fails under EVERY platform
model by more than SURE_TOL_PX = 2 px at 96 dpi; report.md approach C, kept by Patrick 2026-10-04):

NUMBERS ('####').  A visible numeric or date cell - constant or formula result, spill / array
members included - FAILS when the text Excel displays for it (its full number format, including a
conditional-format number format that applies) is wider than the column's text area under EVERY
platform model by more than SURE_TOL_PX.  Excel then shows '####' whatever the viewer's platform.

  * Platform models (MODELS): Windows 96 dpi and 120 dpi (Excel for Mac behaves like the 120 dpi
    grid: a 9 px digit for Calibri 11), each with per-glyph rounded advances (GDI) and fractional
    advances.  A cell that overflows under some models only is a "band" case: reported in stats,
    never a mistake.
  * Column text area = column pixels - CELL_MARGIN_PX (5), merged spans summed for the anchor cell
    (covered cells are not displayed).  Column pixels follow ECMA-376 col/@width:
    px = trunc(((256 * w + trunc(128 / MDW)) / 256) * MDW), where MDW is the Normal font's maximum
    digit width in whole pixels at the model's dpi (7 px for Calibri 11, Aptos Narrow 11 and Arial
    10 at 96 dpi; 9 px at 120 dpi).  A column without <col> is baseColWidth (8) digits + 5 px rounded
    up to a multiple of 8 px, or sheetFormatPr/@defaultColWidth through the formula; for a
    LibreOffice-style defaultColWidth the lenient reading trunc(w * MDW + 5) is also allowed in the
    non-reference models (Excel's reading of it is unverified).
  * Text width = sum of the glyph advances of the cell's own font face, size and weight (GLYPHS,
    1/1000 em per character, read once from the real font files with fontTools - see
    detchecks/scratch/colwidths/glyph_table.py).  Rounded model: each advance rounded to whole
    pixels at ppem = size * dpi / 72 (plain rounding; the fonts' hdmx tables agree with it for
    Arial, and Calibri / Aptos have none).  Padding tokens `_x` are measured as the glyph x;
    `?` blanks as a space (Excel: a digit width; lenient).  Unknown faces are measured as Calibri,
    the narrowest common face (a miss, never a false '###'), and listed in stats.
  * Alignment indent (left / right / distributed) takes INDENT_SPACES_PER_LEVEL (3) Normal-font
    spaces per level off the text area, as in Reasonable row heights (73).
  * General format never shows '####' while a shorter rendering exists: Excel rounds decimals away
    and falls back to d E+nn scientific notation.  The need of a General cell is therefore the
    narrowest of its full text, its 0-decimal rounding and its 1-digit scientific form.
  * Dates count (they are numbers; toy T3).  Negative / out-of-range dates show '#####' at any width
    and are not a width defect (NEGATIVE_DATE_FAILS = False; counted in stats).
  * Shrink-to-fit cells never show '####' (exempt).  Cells in hidden rows or columns (hidden flag,
    zero width / height) are not displayed and are skipped (No hidden rows/columns (93) owns them),
    except the anchor of a merge whose span still has a visible column and a visible row: Excel draws
    the merged value across the visible part, so it is measured against the span's visible columns in
    a second pass (review fix 69-F4; HIDDEN_ANCHOR_SPAN).
    Hidden sheets ARE graded (whole-workbook rule, as 73 and 66 do).  Fill, centre-across-selection
    and rotated numbers are skipped (how Excel clips them is unverified; counted in stats).
    Booleans and errors are not values this check measures.

CUT-OFF TEXT (Patrick 2026-10-04: text of any length, anywhere in the workbook, that cannot be fully
seen fails; text running into empty neighbours and staying visible is fine).  Displayed text =
constants (numbers stored as text included) and trusted text formula results, through the cell's
number format (a text section can add to it or blank it).  Same models, glyph tables (characters
outside them: accented letters as their base letter, East Asian wide characters 1 em, combining
marks 0, anything else a digit), indent, tolerance and hidden-row / hidden-column / hidden-sheet
scope as the numbers.  Rich text is measured run by run (run size and weight; the reader keeps no
run face).
  (a) Unwrapped text (TEXT_CLIP) is cut off when its visible glyphs (blanks at the ends only push
      them) reach past the space it can use under EVERY model by more than SURE_TOL_PX (typed line
      breaks show as nothing).  Space = its column (or merged span) text area plus the
      contiguous EMPTY cells in the direction it overflows: general / left alignment to the right,
      right alignment to the left, center to both sides (each side must hold half the excess).
      Overflow stops at the first non-empty cell (a value, any formula result - "" included - a
      boolean or error, an empty-string constant), at a merged range (MERGES_BLOCK_OVERFLOW: merged
      cells take no overflow), and at the sheet's first / last column.  An empty cell in a hidden
      column lets the text through (0 px of room); a filled cell in a hidden column still stops it
      (HIDDEN_CELLS_BLOCK_OVERFLOW).  Text never spills out of a merge: an anchor's space is the
      merge's visible width.  Centre-across-selection text is centred over the cell and the
      contiguous empty cells to its right that carry the same alignment, then overflows both ways
      like centred text; fill text never spills (space = the cell and the contiguous empty
      fill-aligned cells to its right).  Shrink-to-fit text is never cut off; rotated text is
      skipped (counted).
  (b) Wrapped text (WRAPPED_TEXT_CLIP; wrapText, or justify / distributed alignment) is cut off when
      it needs more lines than its row shows - only in rows with a custom height (customHeight=1):
      Excel auto-fits every other row on open (docs/excel_measurements.md item 6).  Lines: the
      greedy word wrap of Reasonable row heights (73) (c73.wrap_lines) with this check's per-glyph
      widths in the cell's column (or merged span), under every model; the FEWEST lines count.
      Line height: c73's LINE_HEIGHT_PER_PT x font size.  The row shows height / line height lines;
      the text is cut off when more than WRAP_HIDDEN_LINES_TOL (half a line) is hidden.  A merge
      over several rows counts the custom heights of its visible rows; with any auto-fitted row in
      it, it is not graded (counted).

Values.  Constants are read from the file and routed by their stored type.  A formula result is
routed by its TRUSTED value, never by the delivered `t` attribute (review fix 69-F1: `t` is a cache
attribute - agent tools write t="str" placeholders with empty caches, LibreOffice a #NAME? placeholder -
so a number behind such a placeholder was never measured, even when a value copy held it).  A trusted
value (Excel cache, LibreOffice copy, unknown-writer cache) that is a number is measured; a trusted
text result goes to the text rules; a boolean / error result is not a value this check measures (the
recalc pipeline vets a LibreOffice copy's #NAME? / #VALUE! values, so with it those cells are trusted
errors and skipped, as ruled 2026-10-04).  An untrusted value (openpyxl / XlsxWriter cache, no cache, a
LibreOffice-written #NAME? / #VALUE! cache read without the pipeline, missing from the copy) leaves the
cell undecided whatever its placeholder type - unless its display cannot depend on the value: a covered
(non-anchor) merged cell is never displayed, and a format that prints nothing for every number AND
every text (';;;') shows nothing (review fix 69-F2; a conditional-format number format over the cell
keeps it undecided).  If the workbook fails on measured cells anyway, undecided cells are listed in
stats and nothing is raised (UNTRUSTED_ONLY_IF_VERDICT_NEEDS); otherwise the first one raises
GradingError (no fallback).  The same holds for a conditional-format number format whose rule cannot
be evaluated when the possible displays disagree, and for a rendering numfmt marks uncertain.

Conditional formats.  Sheets whose rules carry a number format (dxf numFmt) are streamed a second
time: every numeric cell inside such a range is rendered under each possible outcome (c66.fires
decides which rules fire; unknown rules branch), and the cell fails only if every outcome overflows.
First-pass candidates inside those ranges are handed to the second pass.  (A conditional format
does not change how text is displayed here.)

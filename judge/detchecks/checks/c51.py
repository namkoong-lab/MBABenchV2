"""51 Formatting/Red font for external links.

Rule (Patrick's confirmed colour rule, 2026-10-02; details in docs/checks/51.md and
colour_rules.py): every formula cell of the delivered workbook (all sheets, hidden ones too)
whose formula reads another WORKBOOK anywhere - directly ([1]Prices!$C$5,
'C:\\p\\[Book.xlsx]S'!A1, [1]!Name), inside a calculation (=[1]Rates!$B$2*C25), through a
defined name whose definition reads another workbook, or through a literal
INDIRECT("'[Book.xlsx]S'!A1") - must have a RED font.  A pure pointer to another workbook is
judged here, not by check 50.  Spill / array members take their anchor's formula.

No such cell -> pass ("satisfied by default", rubric), whatever else the workbook holds.
External references that live only in defined names, charts, data validation or conditional
formats (not used by any cell) are check 95's business.  Red cells are never classified.

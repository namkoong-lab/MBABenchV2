"""49 Formatting/Black font for calculations.

Rule (Patrick's confirmed colour rule, 2026-10-02, applied fully 2026-10-03; details in
docs/checks/49.md and colour_rules.py): every formula cell of the delivered workbook (all
sheets, hidden ones too) is classified by what its formula reads; 49 judges two classes:

    OWN       uses only its own sheet, or no reference at all        -> must be black
    CROSS     calculates with another sheet's cells                  -> black or green
    POINTER   only points at another sheet's cell / range            -> NOT judged here (check 50)
    EXTERNAL  reads another workbook                                 -> NOT judged here (check 51)

So 49 fails a non-black formula that is OWN, and a CROSS formula that is neither black nor
green (guidance: "Green is acceptable only when the formula itself references another sheet").
Black cells are never classified (black is fine in every class); green cells with a direct
reference to another sheet are CROSS, POINTER or EXTERNAL, all fine here, and are accepted
without a full parse.  A red / blue / grey / white ... cell needs its class (it is fine only
as a POINTER or EXTERNAL cell); when the formula cannot be classified it still fails if it
cannot possibly be a pointer or read another workbook (cheap conservative pre-filters), else
GradingError.  HYPERLINK navigation cells are ignored (ruling 2026-10-03, "not a calculation";
colour_rules.is_hyperlink_formula: a HYPERLINK call alone, or - since the 2026-10-04 review -
inside IFERROR / IFNA / IF guards whose other arguments are literals, e.g. the ChatGPT writer's
=IFERROR(HYPERLINK("#'Summary'!A1","OPEN"),"OPEN")).

A green formula that is otherwise OWN and whose INDIRECT address is built from cell contents:
when the address is one own-sheet cell (=INDIRECT(A20)*2) that cell is read in a second pass
(a constant: its text is the address; a formula: GradingError); any other computed address
cannot be decided and raises GradingError (no guess).  In any other non-black colour such a
cell fails whatever the address names (OWN or CROSS are both wrong), so the address is not
read and the mistake says so (reason INDIRECT_UNKNOWN, 2026-10-04) instead of claiming the
formula uses only its own sheet.

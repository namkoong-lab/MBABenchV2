"""66 Formatting/Zeros as dashes.

Rule (House Standards "Zeros as dashes"; rubric_9 #66; Patrick 2026-10-02: the plain rule
applies, so counters and 1/0 switches showing 0 must also show a dash).  Full write-up in
docs/checks/66.md.

Every cell holding a NUMERIC value of EXACTLY 0 (a constant or a formula result, on every
worksheet: hidden sheets, rows and columns included; whole delivered workbook) must DISPLAY a
dash.  What the cell displays is worked out as Excel does:
  * its number format's section for 0 (3+ sections: the 3rd; 1-2 sections: the 1st;
    conditional sections; built-in ids from the en-US table: 41-44 dash, 37-40 digits),
    rendered by detchecks.core.numfmt;
  * a conditional format that fires on the cell and carries a number format replaces it
    (rules evaluated per cell with the shared evaluator, checks/_cfeval.py: cellIs, text rules,
    blanks / errors, expressions reading the cell, other cells and other sheets).  Patrick
    2026-10-05, "CONDITIONAL FORMATS never stop a grading": a rule that cannot be evaluated is
    taken as OFF, and a conditional format whose display Excel's reading of is not verified is
    ignored - the cell is graded by its own number format; every such assumption is recorded in
    stats.cf_assumptions;
  * the sheet option showZeros="0" hides it under General and single-section formats, but NOT
    under a format with an explicit zero section (3 numeric sections), which still prints that
    section (Excel, measured 2026-10-03, base formats only: under a conditional format's number
    format a digit / text zero is not verified: the cell's own format is used instead, as above);
    data bars / icon sets with showValue="0" hide it.
Outcome per zero cell (constants below):
  dash      only dash characters ('-', en/em dash, minus sign) besides spaces / padding,
            currency symbols, brackets and the format's own number decorations (the literals
            its positive section prints around every number: "kr", "CHF", "USD ", "x", " bps",
            '%'): '-', ' -   ', ' $-   ', ' -   kr', 'CHF -', '-x', '(-)', '* -' fill         -> pass
  digit     '0', '0.00', '0%', '$0.00', '0.00E+00', General '0', '@' -> '0'           -> FAIL
  text      visible, no digit, not only dashes ("nil", "n/a", "n-a", "zero-rated",
            a label the positive section does not print: '0;-0;"-x"')                -> FAIL  (NON_DASH_TEXT_FAILS,
                                                                                         STRICT_DASH)
  blank     ';;;', an empty zero section (the FORMAT prints nothing)                  -> pass  (BLANK_ZERO_PASSES;
                                                                                         check 94 charges it)
  hidden    showZeros=0 sheet (no zero section), hidden-value data bar / icon set   -> pass  (HIDDEN_ZERO_PASSES;
            (NOT charged by 94)                                                         question for Patrick)
  date/time a date or time format (0 shows '1/0/1900', '0:00')                        -> not judged (DATE_TIME_IN_SCOPE)
  uncertain Excel's display is unmeasured: any render of the cell's OWN format the engine
            marks certain=False, e.g. a section mixing digit placeholders with unquoted date
            letters ('0 bps', '0 days': core numfmt.mixed_date_letters, review 66-S3)    -> GradingError
            (under a CONDITIONAL-format number format - also a digit / text zero on a showZeros=0
            sheet - the cell is graded by its own format instead: Patrick 2026-10-05)
Never judged (not numeric zeros): booleans (FALSE), text '0', errors, empty cells, formulas
returning "".  Non-anchor cells of a merged range are not displayed and are not judged
(SKIP_MERGED_NON_ANCHOR).  Values that are not exactly 0 (a 2.33E-10 residue showing '0.00')
are not zeros (DISPLAYED_ZERO_COUNTS = False).

Values are read only where the decision needs them: a formula result is read only when its
formatting would show a zero as something other than a pass (base format on this sheet, or a
conditional format that may fire).  An untrusted value is not refused at once: the cell is
buffered until the sheet tail (merges, conditional formats) is known, and GradingError (no
fallback) is raised only if a zero there would still fail (MAX_DEFERRED cells per sheet are
buffered; the rest are re-checked in a second pass).
Members of a multi-cell array / data-table range that are not written in the file (no <c>; some
writers store only the anchor) are displayed by Excel under the row / column style; when such a
style (or a conditional format there) could show a zero as a non-pass, their values are needed
and unavailable -> GradingError.

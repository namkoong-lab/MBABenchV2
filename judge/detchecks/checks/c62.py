"""62 Formatting/Active cell reset to A1 on all sheets.

Rule as implemented (Patrick's ruling 2026-10-02: STRICT A1; see docs/checks/62.md):
fail on every sheet whose cursor (active cell) is not A1 when the workbook opens.  The
frozen-pane-corner / "designated home cell" exception is dropped: a frozen sheet whose
cursor sits on the first unfrozen cell (A4, F4, ...) fails too.

* The cursor is read from the sheet's view for workbook window 0 (SheetHead.view): the
  <selection> of the view's ACTIVE pane (<pane activePane>, topLeft without a pane), NOT
  simply the first <selection> (toys 62 T2 'Utilities' and T3 'Solution Model' carry a
  stale first selection of another pane).
* No sheetView, or no selection at all on a view without panes: the cursor is A1 (Excel's
  default; Excel omits an A1 selection, even on a scrolled view: toy 94 T4 'NXTI IS').
* A view with panes whose ACTIVE pane (not topLeft) has no selection (another pane may have
  one): the cursor is that pane's top-left cell (pane topLeftCell, else the frozen corner),
  as Excel does (measured by Patrick 2026-10-03, attempt 1408: frozen sheets whose only
  selection is A1 in the topLeft pane open on D7 / F10, the first scrolling cell;
  ACTIVE_PANE_WITHOUT_SELECTION = "pane_top_left").  Such sheets are listed in
  stats.active_pane_without_selection.  The measurement covered panes parked AT the frozen
  corner only: when the scrolling pane is parked beyond it (GPT-6 1353: pane topLeftCell R6,
  corner F6) the pane's topLeftCell stays the primary reading and the corner is kept as a
  second candidate (both fail strict A1; re-review 2026-10-04, `62-scrolled-pane-location`).
* A view with panes whose active pane is topLeft and has no topLeft selection: A1 (Excel's
  default) when the view's topLeftCell is A1; when the view is scrolled (topLeftCell C1), A1
  and C1 (the pane's top-left cell, by the 1408 reading) are both candidates: not measured
  (re-review 2026-10-04, `62-topleft-active-ignores-view-scroll`; 0 corpus sheets).
* A selection without activeCell: A1 when its sqref is absent or starts at A1.
* A missing sqref is the schema default "A1" (ECMA-376 CT_Selection), so
  <selection activeCell="D10"/> is the same shape as <selection activeCell="D10" sqref="A1"/>.
* A view WITHOUT <pane> whose selections carry a pane label other than topLeft (stray labels:
  openpyxl keeps them after `ws.freeze_panes = None`): every such selection's cell is a
  candidate next to the topLeft reading (default A1), because Excel's resolution is not
  measured (re-review 2026-10-04, `62-stray-pane-label-silent-a1`; 0 corpus sheets).  Listed
  in stats.selections_labelled_without_pane.
* Shapes whose cursor Excel resolves in an unverified way (several selections for the
  active pane; a selection without activeCell whose sqref starts elsewhere; an activeCell
  outside its own sqref, explicit or default; the three shapes above) keep every plausible
  cursor as a candidate.  All candidates A1 -> the sheet passes; none A1 -> it fails
  (location = the primary reading); mixed -> the sheet is undecidable.
* Counted sheets: worksheets, dialog sheets and macro sheets, hidden and very hidden ones
  included (whole workbook; INCLUDE_HIDDEN_SHEETS).  Chart sheets have no cell cursor:
  listed in stats only.
* Scroll position (sheetView/pane topLeftCell) is not judged (CHECK_SCROLL = False, a
  question for Patrick); views that open scrolled away from A1 are listed in stats.

Decision: fail when at least one counted sheet fails for certain (undecidable sheets are
then listed in stats.undecidable_sheets, never in mistakes); otherwise GradingError when a
sheet is undecidable (an unreadable activeCell/sqref/activePane on the selection that
decides, or mixed candidates); otherwise pass.  The verdict therefore raises only when an
unknown cursor could change it (no guess).
Mistakes: one per failing sheet, location "'Sheet'!<cursor cell>".

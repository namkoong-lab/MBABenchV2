"""Shared rules for the font-colour checks 49 / 50 / 51 (group "colours").

Patrick's confirmed colour rule (handoff, 2026-10-02).  Every formula cell is put in one class:

    EXTERNAL  reads another WORKBOOK anywhere in the formula (directly, through a defined
              name, or through a literal INDIRECT("'[Book.xlsx]S'!A1"))       -> red    (51)
    POINTER   otherwise, the formula is ONLY a reference to a cell / range on ANOTHER sheet
              of this workbook (=Inputs!B5, also =+Inputs!B5, =(Inputs!B5), =-Inputs!B5,
              =Inputs!B5#, =@Inputs!B5:B9, =ANCHORARRAY(Inputs!B5), =TOROW(Inputs!B5:B9), a
              defined name / table that resolves to another sheet)            -> green  (50)
    CROSS     otherwise, the formula calculates with another sheet's cells
              (=Inputs!B5*C3, =SUM(Inputs!A1:A9), =WACC*B2 with WACC on Inputs) -> black or green
    OWN       otherwise: uses only its own sheet (incl. self-qualified 'Own'!A1), or no
              reference at all (=5, =TODAY(), ="text")                         -> black  (49)

Each class is judged by exactly one check (confirmed rule applied fully, Patrick 2026-10-03):
49 judges OWN (black) and CROSS (black or green); 50 judges POINTER (green); 51 judges
EXTERNAL (red).  A blue pointer therefore fails 50 only, a blue external link 51 only.

The colour that counts is the cell's FONT colour (cellXfs -> fonts -> color, resolved with
the workbook's theme / indexed palette / tint by detchecks.core.styles).  Number-format colour
tags ([Blue]0) and conditional-format font colours do not change it (see the constants and
docs/checks/49.md).  Colour families (HSV bands on the resolved RGB) are defined here once.

HYPERLINK cells (Patrick's ruling 2026-10-03: navigation links may be any colour, "not a
calculation"): a navigation cell is ignored by 49, 50 and 51 (is_hyperlink_formula).  After
optional whitespace / one leading '=', the whole formula is either a single built-in
HYPERLINK(...) call (nothing before its name, nothing after its closing parenthesis), or - since
2026-10-04, second review - one of the guard functions HYPERLINK_GUARDS (IFERROR, IFNA, IF)
around such a call whose every other argument is a single literal or empty:
=IFERROR(HYPERLINK("#'Summary'!A1","OPEN"),"OPEN") (the ChatGPT writer's standard navigation
cell), =IF(TRUE,HYPERLINK(...),""), guards may nest.  The HYPERLINK call's own arguments are
free (they build the link).  Anything that calculates around the link is graded like any other
formula: a guard argument that reads a cell or calculates (=IF(B9>0,HYPERLINK(...),""),
=IFERROR(HYPERLINK(...),C1*2)), =HYPERLINK(...)&"", =(HYPERLINK(...)), =+HYPERLINK(...),
HYPERLINK inside any other function.  Spill members and shared-formula children take their
anchor's / master's text, so they are ignored with it.

Formula cells: every cell with its own formula (normal, shared master or child, array or
dataTable anchor) and every non-anchor member of an array / dynamic-array spill / data-table
range.  Members take their anchor's class; their own font colour is judged.  Empty <f/>
markers outside any array range carry no formula: they are not formula cells (stats only).

Classification is syntactic (formula text + defined names + table parts); cell values are
never read, except that 49 reads the one constant cell an =INDIRECT(A20) address comes from
when (and only when) that decides a green cell.  A check works out only what its decision
needs (NO FALLBACK, but raise only where the decision needs it):
  * a cell in the check's safe colour (49 black, 50 green, 51 red) is never classified;
  * a cheap conservative pre-filter skips formulas that cannot be in a failing class
    (49: green formulas with a direct reference to another sheet; 50: formulas that cannot be
    a pure reference; 51: formulas that cannot read another workbook);
  * a font colour that cannot be resolved raises only when the cell's class makes the colour
    decide the verdict (49: OWN / CROSS cells; 50: pointers; 51: external cells);
  * 49: a non-black, non-green formula that cannot be classified still fails when cheap scans
    show it can be neither a pointer nor a reader of another workbook (else it raises);
  * a defined name whose scope is unknown (bad localSheetId) raises only where the possible
    definitions could change this check's decision.

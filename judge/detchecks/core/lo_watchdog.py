"""LibreOffice watchdog: a LibreOffice conversion must never outlive the grading that started it.

core/recalc.libreoffice_recalc does not start soffice itself. It starts this file as a tiny wrapper,

    <python> -I -S lo_watchdog.py <grader pid> <poll seconds> -- <soffice> <arguments ...>

which runs soffice as its own child, in the grader's process group (so a signal sent to the
grader's group - Ctrl-C, heavy_run's group kill - reaches soffice too), and passes soffice's exit
code through.  Every <poll seconds> it checks that the grader is still its parent: when the grader
is gone (killed with SIGKILL, crashed - anything that runs no clean-up), the wrapper is re-parented,
notices, and kills soffice and everything soffice started (kill_tree), then exits.  SIGTERM, SIGINT
and SIGHUP sent to the wrapper do the same.  The grader's own side (a SIGTERM handler, the timeout
kill, the profile sweep) is in core/recalc.py.

Standard library only: the wrapper runs with -I -S, outside the package.  core/recalc.py imports
process_table / kill_tree from here, so there is one tree-kill for both sides.

Exit codes of the wrapper: soffice's own; 128 + N when soffice was ended by signal N (and a line
on stderr says so); 125 when the grader was already gone (soffice then never ran or was killed).
